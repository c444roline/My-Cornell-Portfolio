This is my final submission where I built a data frame to organize and manage my data, defined the machine learning problem I aimed to solve, and performed exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of my data. I also outlined a detailed project plan, including the steps and methodologies I used. Finally, I implemented my project plan by preparing and cleaning the data, fitting the model to the training data, evaluating its performance, and optimizing the model to improve its accuracy and effectiveness
